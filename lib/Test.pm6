## Goals:

* Remove code spaghettification
* Remove duplicate logic
* Avoid having a whole bunch of global variables
* Try to improve performance
* ???
* Profit!

-----------------------------------------------------

## Routine Categories

### Control Routines

* Plan number of tests
* Indicate we're done testing
* Skip X amount of tests
* Bail out of the test suite
* Die on failures
* Alter output handler

Routines in category: ✓`plan`, ✓`done-testing`, ✓`skip`, ✓`skip-rest`,
✓`bail-out`, ✓`output`, ✓`failure-output`, ✓`todo-output`

Env vars in category: ✓`PERL6_TEST_DIE_ON_FAIL`

### Grouping Routines

* Mark next X amount of tests as TODO
* Group X amount of tests as a separate mini-test-suite

Routines in category: ✓`todo`, ✓`subtest`

### Testing Routines

* Take operation that produces True/False and input
    - Do X on True
    - Do Y on False

Routines in category: ✓`pass`, ✓`ok`, ✓`nok`, ✓`is`, ✓`isnt`, ✓`cmp-ok`,
✓`is-approx`, ✓`flunk`, ✓`isa-ok`, ✓`does-ok`, ✓`can-ok`, ✓`like`,
✓`unlike`, ✓`use-ok`, ✓`dies-ok`, ✓`lives-ok`,
✓`eval-dies-ok`, ✓`eval-lives-ok`, ✓`is-deeply`, ✓`throws-like`

### Auxiliary Routines

* Display arbitrary messages requested by test author

Routines in category: ✓`diag`

-----------------------------------------------------

## Structure

The module uses a `Tester` class that keeps state as well as provides
a single pass/fail testing interface on which all other test routines rely on.
Only one instance of `Tester` exists per test *level*, which means a
`subtest` invocation creates its own instance, with its own state.

### State

State is stored in `Tester` class that is set during object's instantiation
and can be altered by the routines in the **Control Routines** category.

The object is pushed into a module-wide array that functions as a stack of
Tester classes, each handling subtests. A subtest entry pushes a new Tester
object onto the stack and exit from subtest pops one off.

### Testing

*speculative section; needs trial implementanions and benching*

Each of the routines in **Testing Routines** will invoke `Tester`'s single
test subroutine by telling it the operation to perform and what to do on
True/False.

The test routine will handle marking the test as TODO, correctly directing
the output, dying on failures, and emitting proper TAP output, depending on
the outcome of the provided test operation.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Issues in the old Test.pm6 found during refactoring:

* like (Failure, Regex) and unlike (Failure, Regex) candidates do not exist,
despite existing candidates having logic to handle failures (they won't ever
get there)

* unlike() generates confusing diag() message one failure:
<TestNinja> m: use Test; unlike 'foo', /foo/
<camelia> rakudo-moar 2c95f7: OUTPUT«not ok 1 - ␤␤# Failed test at <tmp>
    line 1␤#      expected: '/foo/'␤#      got: 'foo'␤»

* Inconsistency of failure output between lives-ok and eval-lives-ok

* multi-line diag() in subtests does not indent subsequent lines correctly

* Double-space in non-Numeric skip count warning: die "skip() was passed a
non-numeric number of tests.  Did you get the arguments backwards?" if $count
!~~ Numeric;

* skip backslashes the '#' before SKIP, even thought that's not needed

* throws-like has incosistent "code died/dies" message on failure to die;
as well as capitalization of Expected/Got messages. Different indent
for the expected got messages. Also, Test.pm6 is referenced in failures.
ALSO, the message for "code dies" is not printed when the code given is a
Failure

* todo() does not have the same API as skip() [check count is numeric; let
omit description]

* Test whether we actually need to escape hashmarks in TODO reasons

-------------------------------------

TODO:

Refactor diag()
Add --> Nil to all routines that matter

* Some sort of a crash with large number of failing tests. Present in both
new and old version:
